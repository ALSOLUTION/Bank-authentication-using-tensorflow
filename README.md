# Bank-Authentication-Dataset

We'll use the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication">Bank Authentication Data Set</a> from the UCI repository.
The data consists of 5 columns:

1.variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)<Br>
2.skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)<Br>
3.curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)<Br>
4.entropy of image (continuous)<Br>
5.class (integer) <B>(Target Class)</B> <Br>

Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.

This sort of task is perfectly suited for Neural Networks and Deep Learning!
